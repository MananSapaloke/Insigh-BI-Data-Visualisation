## üåü About This Project

In today's data-driven world, the ability to quickly understand business performance is crucial. The **Insigh BI Dashboard** was created to address this need by providing a centralized, high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs).

The dashboard is split into two main views:
1.  **Financial Overview:** Focuses on profitability and financial health.
2.  **Supply & Demand Analysis:** Provides insights into operational efficiency and supply chain management.

The clean, modern interface ensures that even complex data is presented in a digestible format, allowing stakeholders to identify trends, spot anomalies, and make informed decisions without delay.
